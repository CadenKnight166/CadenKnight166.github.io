          <h2>Space 101: The Difference Between 3 of My Favorite Celestial Bodies</h2>

            PULSAR vs. QUASAR vs. BLAZAR

            PULSAR: A pulsar is a magnetized neutron star that emits periodic short pulses of radiation by rapid rotation at high
            speeds that travel up to several light years before dissipating into matter particles. Categorized as a star,
            these bodies have hypothetically been around for billions of years. The most recent and accurate guess to their
            beginnings is that pulsars start as regular stars that go through an explosion known as a "supernova" and enter
            a constant state of rotation as a result of lasting momentum after explosion, but this has not been confirmed nor
            denied as all found pulsars are at least thousands of years old. The first pulsar was discovered in 1967, when a
            postgraduate  student, Jocelyn Bell, observed strange, almost mechanical-like pulses in the form of radio signals
            (about  1.33 seconds apart). The rhythm was jokingly nicknamed “LGM-1”, or “Little Green Men 1”, as the synthetic 
            nature of the pulses appeared to be made by something unnatural (upon further research, this was debunked, 
            but the idea is still cool yk?). Through discoveries made by astronomers and scientists over time, the 
            conclusion of a “pulsar” was published in February of 1968. This was seen as a MAJOR astronomical find, 
            as nothing like this had been officially found up until this point, and the discovery has made Bell a widely 
            renowned astrophysicist.

            (UNFINISHED) QUASAR: A quasar is a supermassive black hole that emits massive amounts of energy as it consumes matter at the
            center of a galaxy. Quasars are categorized as active galactic nuclei. The first quasar was discovered in 1963,

            (UNFINISHED) BLAZAR: A blazar is a supermassive black hole that emits a jet of high-energy particles and radiation directly
            towards Earth.
